# Boxen setup script
A simple shell script to setup a Boxen instance on a SMM Machine.

## Use me
If you are setting up a computer from scratch you will need the OS X
command line tools. Open Appllications > Utilities > Terminal.app. Type:

`xcode-select --install`

and select `Install`. You should not need to install the full Xcode suite, just
the command line tools.

Then run:

1. `git clone https://github.com/scimusmn/boxen-setup.git`
1. `cd boxen-setup`
1. `./boxen-setup.sh`

The inital run can take anywhere between tens of minutes to multiple hours.

*Resist the urge to cancel out of the process. It can cause errors while
software is compiling.*

## What does it do?
1. Creates the Boxen directory
1. Sets the correct permissions
1. Clones our Boxen manifest
1. Runs Boxen for the first time, ignoring encryption requirement, with debug
   mode enabled.

We enable debug just because the first run takes a pretty long time (tens of
minutes to hours) and it's helpful to be able to see that something's actually
happening, during the setup.

## Troubleshooting
If there are problems loop through these solutions:

1. Relaunch Terminal
1. Run `boxen` again.
1. Install the latest OS software updates.
1. Restart

Because Boxen is
[idempotent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence#Computer_science_meaning)
you can run it multiple times without causing problems.  If something doesn't
work, just keep running `boxen` and restarting until all errors disapear.

### Command line tools install
When you try to install the command line tools, you get an error saying:

> Can't install the software because it is not currently available from the
> Software Update server.

You probably have already installed the command line tools.

### Can't bootstrap
When you first run the `./boxen-setup.sh` script, you get an error talking about:

> Can't bootstrap dependencies are outdated

This is a [known issue](https://github.com/boxen/our-boxen/issues/61) on OS X
Mavericks and the latest Xcode. To fix this, I've added this option to the 
default install script.
